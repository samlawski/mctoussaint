        <p>'Music is my elixir' is not only the main statement of the first single of Claire Saints debut album, it is also her life motto.</p>
        <p>As Marie-Claire Toussaint born and raised in Berlin, she got to know a lot of different types of art, especially music. Next to a comprehensive education while going to school (singing in a choir, conducting, singing, music as an advanced course), she took piano, guitar and singing lessons. She was part of several bands and started within different music projects to write her own songs. In 2009, she released her first EP &bdquo;Cover me&ldquo; with four songs in English that can still be found on her SoundCloud page.</p>
        <p>The real transition started when she met Florian Streso in 2015, who was also doing music. She had the voice and the melodies he was always searching for, he had the lyrics she always wanted to sing. Within the project &bdquo;Claireffendi&ldquo;, they produced wonderful, self-written songs. Some of these songs will also be released on Claire Saints debut album.</p>
        <p>She produced her first album in America at the Shuffle Brother Studios. Together with Gideon Klein and Gabriel Klein she is giving the very deep and authenic lyrics an unique sound that inspires the listener and raises a very new type of pop music.</p>
        <p>After Claire Saint finished school, she lived in Nashville for 8 months. Having the chance to stay with the musician Neal Morse and his family, she built a connection to the country, the people, the music and the language overthere. That is why, she decided to split up her album into 2 CD&rsquo;s, one part with German songs and one part with English songs. This shall describe Claire Saints life between and within these two worlds. Because her first double-album is a portrait of her life, it is called 'This is Claire Saint'. The album will be released on the 12/27/19.</p>
        <p>Claire Saint has a lot of stage experience because of several singing and choir concerts in different countries (Hungary, Estonia, Italy, annual concerts at the Konzerthaus and in the Philharmonie Berlin). It feels like home for her when she gets the opportunity to sing infront of an audience. She also sang at weddings and company events before and still offers the option to book her for those occasions (if you are interested, please contact her via the contact form).</p>
